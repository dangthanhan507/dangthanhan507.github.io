# Sim2real Tactile RL

Our main focus is on sim2real tactile RL. That is, training RL policies in simulation with tactile sensing and transferring them to the real world.

Simulating tactile rgb:
- [Taxim](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.040273)
- [TacSL](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10912733)
    - Technically it comes from: [tactilesim](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=6BIffCl6gsM)


Only work that does sim2real on shear fields is

# Things I want to Learn

## Grip Fighting
- [Grip Fighting Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB7f0MrK_Yo)
    - Cross Collar grip RvR break:
        - 7:07-8:48
        - Let go of sleeve grip and put arm over the cross collar grip arm (punch their chest).
        - Turn towards the "punch" and pull back on my own leading arm (right).
        - Once they let go of the throw, use my own leading arm to push their arm out and feed it to my other hand (strong wrist grip).
        - EXTRA MOVE: do a snap down on the wrist grip.
            - Get higher collar grip using snap down.
    - Deal with double collar stiff arm RvR:
        - 9:23-12:27
        - right arm goes underneath, left arm goes over.
        - we double collar them back. 
        - we circle on our lead leg (to the right) and then rotate them to their left.
        - RULE OF THUMB: never circle on lead leg unless we know they are playing defensive (posture back and stiff arm).
    - When opponent reaches with their sleeve arm, you can't go past initial point of contact.
        - 12:30-15:20
        - You have to grab their wrist.
        - Go straight for their sleeve arm (using your arm from other side).
        - Double arm on sleeve.
        - If they take your back (it's your movement), you can just turn and throw them.
        - With double grip, tai otoshi sounds useful.
    - Control sleeve arm and they'll never throw (RvR)
        - 15:20-18:50
        - Defense: Stiff arm way down (elbow down).
        - Offense: If your arm is above your chest, you can do maki-komi.
    - Counter Georgian Grip (RvR)
        - 19:20-24:00
        - Moves with Georgian:
            - Uchi Mata
            - Osoto Gari
            - Habo Relis?
            - Ouchi Gari
            - Harai Goshi
        - Don't stay in georgian grip for too long.
        - Grip their belt and keep their hips away.
        - You can also try ouchi gari.
            - Grab belt using your sleeve arm.
            - Pull on belt, and push on lapel.
            - Then backstep and do ouchi gari.
            - Doesn't matter if you can't hit ouchi, it's about defense since georgian is dangerous.
        - Sumi Gaeshi (sacrifice) with Georgian. (not ready)
    - One-handed collar grip (RvR):
        - 26:00-27:15
        - Just turn throws, one-handed osoto, ...etc.
        - Kouchi Makikomi
    - Use body to generate power (kuzushi):
        - 28:00-30:00
        - Use body to whip them toward you.
        - Sell the movement with the chest.
    - What if they two hands on your right hand (RvR):
        - 30:30-33:00
        - Use hips and move to the side.
        - Get your doubled hand above your chest (same intuition as before).
        - Grab their right hand and maybe go for tai otoshi or kouchi gari.
        - If you do kouchi gari, you can follow up with snapping arm down like before and throw other hand high.
    - Ippon Seoi Nage Grip fighting (cross collar):
        - 33:30-34:30
        - Cross collar grip (if they don't resist, throw).
        - If they try counter with stiff arm, catch before it lands and go 2-on-1.
            - If 2-on-1 no resist, snap down or get better position.
            - If they grip your lead arm, you can use your arm to move over their 2-on-1 arm to break off the grip.
            - Once their grip breaks, it's an OPENING. Grab high right after.
    - RvL counter to cross collar grip:
        - 34:45-35:12
        - Post the stiff arm.
        - Grab their cross collar grip arm with your other hand.
        - Draw bow and extend their stiff arm.
    - How to counter O Goshi Grip (RvL):
        - 35:30-37:30
        - If they get belt grip, frame their belt grip arm with same side arm.
        - Tighten the gi jacket by creating distance squeezing your arms together.
    - How to counter high collar (neck) grip and/or/xor wrist grip (RvR):
        - 37:45-40:00
        - With high collar grip, you can treat like a wrestling collar tie and snap them down (make life suck).
        - Option 1: Grab left collar (opposite) and shimmy over the collar tie frame.
        - Option 2: Dip slide back and then forward.
            - as you slide forward, get your collar grip deeper.
            - win wrist grip.
            - turn back to face them, since we have deeper collar grip, their neck grip breaks.
            - use wrist grip arm to grab their broken neck grip.
            - then snap down the arm....
    - Angles and Clubbing
        - 54:00-56:00
        - cross collar grip, block lapel arm.
        - if they come from underneath grip, you throw it out with your elbow.
        - hit him with a hook (that lands on the neck/back).
    - Break sleeve grip (RvR):
        - 60:00-63:00
        - It's about what happens after a grip is broken.
        - C-grip grab their wrist. Then use other hand to pull the sleeve back (due to limits of the jacket).
        - On (LvR) you can actually do sumi-gaeshi from this position.
    - Double lapell grip (RvR):
        - 64:00-68:00

        - Baseball bat like breaking of the grip.
    - Break sleeves:
        - 77:00-78:30
        - just watch the clip.
    - Harai Makikomi
        - 78:45-80:00
    - Overall tips:
        - stay on the left.
        - control the left.

## Followups / Combinations
- Combo 1:
    - Sasai Tsurikomi Ashi
        - Prevent opponent from taking a large step forward.
    - Kouchi Gari

        - then run kouchi on the non-sasaid leg.

        - run deashi on the kouchi'd leg. (non-sasaid leg).

    - O Soto Gari
        - NOTE: Ouchi Gari is a good follow up to Deashi Harai.
- Combo 4:
    - Deashi Harai / Ouchi Gari / Kouchi Gari
    - Follow up with Ippon Seoi Nage.

- [Grip + Foot Combo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IDcphlmj-U)
    - extend the opponent's arm that grabs your lapel.
    - put weight on the extended arm.
    - then run deashi harai on their lead foot (closest to you RvR).
    - NOTE: if you can't hit this, run a kosoto gari on the back foot.

- [Deashi Moves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3bYEi4Uh6Y)
    - Step near (outside of) leg you want to sweep.
    - Pull
    - Deashi Harai

- [Kouchi Gari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjPQZa4Lv8I)
    - Pull on opponent in 50/50:
        - If they don't step forward, run turn throw (ippon seoi nage or o toshi)
        - If they do step forward, run kouchi gari on the leg they stepped forward with.
    - Circle then deashi
    - Kosoto Gari
**NOTE**: you lose power if you don't have a straight up posture when doing a foot sweep.

- [Osoto Depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNwuxvoyL78)
    - Osoto Response for Stiff Arm 1
        - Move on the side
    - Adjust grips (uke's lapel grabbing arm down, uke's label goes up).
        - then just osoto gari.
    - If we throw osoto and they resist (combo)
        - Don't reap (you should feel their resistance through your attempted kuzushi).
        - We hit sasae.
    - Infinity Loop (osoto <-> Sasae)
    - RvL Osoto (turn shoulder and frame well).
    - in RvR, if they step the leg you want to reap away, just like RvL where you keep stepping forward (very important to keep the tension from hand position).
    - If they counter with osoto gari, push arm you're holding way back for a pec fly. 
    - Then you can reach back and do a mat drop (tani otoshi).


## Footwork
- [Footwork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAYFZPhIZqg)
    - If you have dominant hand grips, create movement.
    - If you don't have dominant hand grips, don't do it (it's opponents movement).
    - Hand Grip Tip:
        - Slowly move up the lapel to the collar (I'm pretty good at that).
        - Slowly regrip the sleeve to get it tighter.
        - Pull on lapel, push on sleeve.
        - Or slowly move down the arm to the wrist.
    - Huge tip: once you get really good grip and are pushing / pulling.
        - You can actually reverse the direction of push/pull to get opponent on back foot.
        - After that, do kouchi gari.
    - Good hand grips allow you to float to your setups.

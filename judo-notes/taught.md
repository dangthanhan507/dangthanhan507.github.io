## Forward throws:

**O Goshi**:
- Hip throw
- Grips: One hand on sleeve, one hand on belt from other side.
- Fairly easy transfer from wrestling.
- Kuzushi: Pull on sleeve and belt. 

**Ippon Seoi Nage**:
- One arm shoulder throw.
- Grips: One hand on sleeve, one hand on collar.
- Kuzushi: Pull on sleeve and collar. Turn and uppercut armpit.
- Variations:
    - One hand on sleeve (closest to throwing arm).
    - Morote Seoi Nage: Throw without uppercut, use collar arm as a lever.

**Uki Goshi**:
- Floating hip throw.

**Koshi Guruma**:
- Hip wheel throw.
- Much like head throw in wrestling.

**Uchi Mata (Hip)**:
- Inner thigh throw.
- Grips: One hand on sleeve, one hand on collar.
- Kuzushi: Pull on sleeve and collar.
- You have step in deep (squat lower).
- Then the throw is lifting the leg (slight mount on the hip) and sweeping the leg out.

**Harai Goshi**:
- Hip sweep throw.
- Grips: One hand on sleeve, one hand collar.
- Kuzushi: Pull on sleeve and collar.
- You have to step in deep (squat lower).
- Similar to uchi mata in terms of penetration step.
- Reap with the front leg.
- Compared to Osoto-Gari in terms of ripping the throw.

## Ashi Waza (Foot stuff):

**O Soto Gari**:
- Major outer reap.

**Deashi Harai**:
- Major foot sweep.

nice to learn ashi guruma and kosoto gari.


**Sasae tsurikomi ashi**:
- Major foot block.
- Spinny boi kinda like the muay thai clinch throw.
- Spin oneself to move opponent and block the leading foot.
- Grips: One hand on sleeve, one hand on collar.

**Kouchi gari**: 
- Small inner reap.

**Ouchi gari**:
- Big inner reap.

I suck at kouchi gari and ouchi gari. I also struggle with getting deashi harai to work.

## Pins:

**Kesa Gatame**:
- Scarf hold.

**Kata Gatame**:
- Head arm choke but it's a pin.

**Yoko Shio Gatame**:
- Side control from bjj.

**Uki Gatame**:
- The kenny special
- Knee on belly pin.

**Kami Shiho Gatame**:
- North-south pin.



**NOTE**: not going to focus on sacrifice throws since I think it's low percentage.
